This folder cointains the data used for the calculation of the absorption contrast parameter as well as the dat used for the comparison of the paints and the black and orange segments of the cuticles. 

How to read the names of the names of the files:

* [Green components](https://github.com/malfaro2/Mora_et_al2/tree/master/datos_CICIMA/Green-components): G-green;B-Baryconus,C-Chromoteleia,M-Macroteleia,S-Scelio;B-black,O-orange;# of measurement or "prom" for average
Example: GBB1.dat -> green component for baryconus black segment, measurement #1 
This folder also contains data for the paints: black.dat and orange.dat correspond to the green component of black and orange pigments tested.

* [Reflectance curves](https://github.com/malfaro2/Mora_et_al2/tree/master/datos_CICIMA/Reflectance-curves): b-Baryconus,c-Chromoteleia,m-Macroteleia,s-Scelio; b-black,o-orange;following numbers and letters label spots and days of measurement, but this information was not considered in this work. Data is from reference [2] of the manuscript, in which such variables were considered, no dependence on them was found.
Example: bos11d1.dat -> Baryconus orange

This folder contains also data for the reflectance of the paints: 224+322.csv,224+384.csv,225.csv, 322.csv,358.csv,358+224.csv are black paints, while 224.csv,272.csv,272+225.csv,272+322.csv,272+384.csv,358+358.csv are orange paints
